// tRust: Regression test for rust-lang#154662
// Check that conflicting supertrait associated type bounds are detected
// when constructing dyn trait types. When multiple supertraits constrain
// the same associated type with different concrete types, the resulting
// dyn type would be unsound since the associated type cannot simultaneously
// satisfy both constraints.

    type Assoc;

// Constructing `dyn Sub` should be rejected because Left requires
// Base::Assoc = u32 while Right requires Base::Assoc = String.
