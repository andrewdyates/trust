// Regression test for rust-lang#153989
// Unsized coercion between incompatible types must emit a diagnostic error,
// not generate broken MIR that ICEs during validation.
//
// The ICE occurred because typeck recorded an Unsize coercion adjustment based
// on deferred obligations that later failed. The broken adjustment then produced
// invalid MIR (PointerCoercion::Unsize between non-coercible types) which
// crashed during MIR validation.
//
// This test verifies that the compiler does not ICE on code that attempts
// unsized coercions between incompatible types. Instead, it should produce
// a clean type error.
