// tRust: Regression test for rust-lang#64718 (Command signal safety between fork and exec).
//
// Verifies that signal handlers installed in the parent process are reset to
// SIG_DFL in child processes spawned via Command. This prevents non-async-signal-safe
// handlers (which may call malloc, take locks, etc.) from running in the child's
// fork-exec window, which would cause deadlocks.
//
// The test installs a SIGUSR1 handler in the parent, spawns a child, and the child
// verifies that its SIGUSR1 disposition is SIG_DFL (not the parent's handler).

//@ needs-subprocess
//@ only-unix
//@ ignore-emscripten (no signal support)
