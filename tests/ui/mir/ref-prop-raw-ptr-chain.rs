// tRust: Regression test for rust-lang#132898
// ReferencePropagation must not propagate through raw pointer chains
// to direct places, as this changes aliasing semantics from
// SharedReadWrite to Unique, invalidating live borrows.
//
// check-pass (the fix prevents the optimization, not the code itself)

    // After this point, r1's borrow should be considered potentially
    // invalidated by the raw pointer. ReferencePropagation must not
    // replace uses of `*raw` with direct access to `x`, as that would
    // change the access semantics and could invalidate other borrows.
