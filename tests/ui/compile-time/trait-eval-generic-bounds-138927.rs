// tRust: regression test for compile-time bug rust-lang#138927
//
// Regression in trait evaluation with generic bounds. When a trait has
// multiple generic parameters with interdependent bounds, the trait solver
// may explore an exponentially growing set of candidate implementations.
// Each additional layer of generic bounds multiplies the search space for
// trait resolution.
//
// The original report showed a regression where previously-fast code became
// slow after changes to the trait evaluation cache. This test exercises
// deep generic bound nesting to ensure trait evaluation remains efficient.
//
// Upstream: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/138927
// Tracked in tRust: #865
