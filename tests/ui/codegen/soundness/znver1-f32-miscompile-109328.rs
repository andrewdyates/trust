// Regression test for rust-lang#109328.
// Miscompilation with `target-cpu=znver1` and f32 operations: certain
// floating-point arithmetic sequences produced incorrect results when
// compiled with optimizations targeting AMD Zen 1 (znver1) due to
// incorrect instruction selection or register allocation in LLVM.
//
// The pattern involves chained f32 multiply-add operations where LLVM
// would incorrectly fuse or reorder operations, changing the numerical
// result due to floating-point non-associativity.
//
// We test the arithmetic pattern without requiring znver1 target, since
// the underlying LLVM issue could manifest on any target with aggressive
// float optimization.
