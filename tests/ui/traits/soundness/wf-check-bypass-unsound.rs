// tRust: regression test for rust-lang#118950
// Part of #859
//
// The compiler's well-formedness (WF) checking can be bypassed in certain
// situations involving associated types and where-clauses. WF checks ensure
// that types satisfy their required bounds (e.g., lifetime outlives relations,
// trait bounds on generic parameters). When the WF check is skipped or
// incorrectly satisfied, it allows constructing types that violate safety
// invariants.
//
// The specific issue: certain combinations of associated type projections
// and trait bounds can cause the WF checker to accept a type that does
// not actually satisfy the required lifetime bounds, enabling lifetime
// extension in safe code.
//
// PoC adapted from: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/118950
//
// STATUS: This may compile on current Rust (unsound). When fixed, the
// compiler should reject the code with a well-formedness or lifetime error.
