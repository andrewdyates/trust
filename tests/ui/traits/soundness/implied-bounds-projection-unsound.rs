// tRust: regression test for rust-lang#100051
// Part of #859
//
// Implied bounds from projections in impl headers can be unsound.
// When an impl has a where-clause like `for<'what, 'ever> &'what &'ever (): Trait`,
// the compiler uses implied bounds from the projection `<&'b &'a () as Trait>::Type`
// to satisfy lifetime constraints that should not be satisfiable, allowing
// an `extend` function that converts `&'a str` to `&'b str` for arbitrary lifetimes.
//
// This is a variant of #98543 with a different failure path not fixed by #99217.
//
// PoC from upstream issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100051
//
// STATUS: This currently COMPILES on stable Rust (unsound). When fixed,
// the compiler should reject the implied bound unsoundness.
