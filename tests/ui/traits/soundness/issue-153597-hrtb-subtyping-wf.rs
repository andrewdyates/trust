// tRust: regression test for rust-lang#153597
// Part of #859
//
// Higher-ranked subtyping (the `binders` method in `TypeRelating`) skips
// WF checks on instantiated types. When checking `for<'a> T_a <: for<'b> T_b`,
// the super type is instantiated with placeholders and the sub type with
// fresh inference variables, then they are related — but neither the
// placeholder-instantiated type nor the inference-variable-instantiated
// type has its well-formedness verified. This allows types with dangling
// lifetime relationships to pass the subtyping check unchecked.
//
// The fix adds WellFormed obligations for instantiated binder types in
// the TypeRelating binders method.
//
// PoC from upstream issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/153597
//
// STATUS: Fixed. WF obligations are now registered for instantiated
// higher-ranked binder types.
