// tRust: regression test for rust-lang#54663
// Part of #859
//
// Incorrect where-clause normalization with projections. The compiler
// incorrectly normalizes associated type projections in where clauses,
// allowing impls to satisfy bounds they should not. When a where clause
// contains a projection like `<T as Trait>::Assoc: Bound`, the compiler
// normalizes this too eagerly, sometimes using an associated type value
// from a different impl than the one actually selected.
//
// The core issue: normalization of projections in where clauses happens
// at a stage where the impl selection is not yet finalized. A where
// clause like `<Foo as Iterator>::Item: Debug` might normalize using
// a blanket impl's associated type even when a more specific impl
// would provide a different type.
//
// PoC adapted from: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54663
//
// STATUS: This demonstrates the where-clause projection normalization
// issue. When fixed, the compiler should defer normalization until
// impl selection is finalized.
