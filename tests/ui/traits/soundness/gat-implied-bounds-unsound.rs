// tRust: regression test for rust-lang#130521
// Part of #859
//
// Implied bounds from GAT (Generic Associated Type) projections are unsound.
// When a GAT has lifetime bounds in its definition (e.g., `type Gat<'a>
// where Self: 'a`), the compiler uses these as implied bounds at call sites.
// However, these implied bounds can be exploited to forge lifetime
// relationships that don't actually hold, allowing lifetime extension.
//
// The core issue: `where Self: 'a` on a GAT provides an implied bound
// that `Self: 'a` whenever `<T as Trait>::Gat<'a>` appears. By
// carefully constructing types, this can be used to prove arbitrary
// lifetime outlives relationships.
//
// PoC adapted from: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/130521
//
// STATUS: This currently COMPILES on stable Rust (unsound). When fixed,
// the compiler should reject the unsound implied bounds from GATs.

trait LendingIterator {
    type Item<'a> where Self: 'a;
}

// The key: this impl says Item<'a> = &'a &'inner str.
// For this to be well-formed, we need 'inner: 'a.
// The GAT's `where Self: 'a` gives us `StringRef<'inner>: 'a`,
// which should imply 'inner: 'a. But the compiler uses this
// in REVERSE — it uses the GAT projection to PROVE that 'inner: 'a
// even when it shouldn't hold.
