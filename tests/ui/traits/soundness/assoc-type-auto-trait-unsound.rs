// tRust: regression test for rust-lang#44454
// Part of #859
//
// Unsound interaction between associated types and auto traits (Send/Sync).
// The compiler incorrectly assumes that a type is Send/Sync based on its
// associated type projection being Send/Sync, without verifying that the
// concrete associated type actually satisfies the auto trait bound.
//
// The core issue: when a trait has an associated type, and the associated
// type is used in a context requiring Send, the compiler's auto trait
// inference may incorrectly conclude the projection is Send even when
// the concrete type is not. This is because auto trait checking for
// projections follows a different code path than concrete types.
//
// PoC adapted from: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44454
//
// STATUS: This demonstrates the unsound auto trait / associated type
// interaction. When fixed, the compiler should correctly verify auto
// trait bounds through associated type projections.
