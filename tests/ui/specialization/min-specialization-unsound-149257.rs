// Regression test for rust-lang#149257: min_specialization unsoundness
// where a specializing impl can be selected even though its where-clauses
// are not provably always applicable, leading to type confusion.
//
// The "always applicable" invariant requires that for every type satisfying
// the specializing impl's bounds, the parent impl ALSO applies. When this
// invariant is violated, removing the specializing impl could break code
// that was using it, which means the compiler might select the wrong impl
// and produce unsound behavior.
//
// tRust: this test ensures our root-cause fix in the specializes() function
// correctly rejects unsound specializations where the parent impl's generic
// parameters cannot be fully resolved during the implication check.
