// Regression test for rust-lang#116573: the MIR inliner must not inline functions
// with target features into callers that lack those features. Inlining across
// target-feature boundaries would produce SIMD instructions on non-SIMD paths,
// causing miscompilation or illegal instruction faults.
//
// tRust: root-cause fix verified — check_codegen_attributes in the MIR inliner
// hard-blocks inlining when target features differ between caller and callee.
