// tRust: Regression test for rust-lang/rust#127336
// Projecting a field of extern type at non-zero offset must not miscompile.
// Previously, codegen would fall through to the DST alignment path which
// either panicked (defensive) or produced a garbage GEP offset (miscompile).
// The fix uses the statically-computed offset from the struct layout.
