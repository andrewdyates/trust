// tRust: Regression test for rust-lang#152463
// Cloning a coroutine that holds references across yield points is unsound
// because the references may be self-referential (pointing into the coroutine's
// own frame). A memcpy clone copies pointer values without fixing them up.
//
// This test verifies that tRust rejects Clone for coroutines with references.
