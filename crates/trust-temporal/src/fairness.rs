// trust-temporal/fairness.rs: Fairness constraints and starvation detection
//
// Provides weak and strong fairness constraints for concurrent state machines,
// fair schedule generation, liveness checking under fairness, and starvation
// detection.
//
// Fairness concepts:
// - Weak fairness (justice): if an action is continuously enabled, it must
//   eventually be taken.
// - Strong fairness (compassion): if an action is enabled infinitely often,
//   it must be taken infinitely often.
// - Unconditional fairness: the action must be taken infinitely often,
//   regardless of whether it is enabled.
// - Starvation: a process/action that can be perpetually bypassed by an
//   unfair scheduler.
